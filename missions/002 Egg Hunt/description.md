This week’s free download is a new side-mission for your campaigns for up to four players. It’s the perfect opportunity to add a couple of new crews (like the newly released Cygnus and Yamato packs) to the mix.

It’s a seasonal affair this time. Giger’s Emporium are hosting their annual Easter Egg Hunt and there are big prizes up for grabs. Send a couple of your Traders into the store to grab whatever they can, but be warned that they won’t be the only ones on the hunt…
