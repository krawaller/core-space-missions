This month the Galactic Corps arrive on the scene. This new Core Space expansion adds the Galactic Corps and Security Wardens as new NPCs, along with the usual host of scenery, equipment, cards, rules and missions.

![Juggernauts are powerful and heavily armed; the hammer of the Corps used to bludgeon and punish any disobedient populace. They are often large men who have been chemically enhanced or have a mutation, normally in favour of size and aggression at the expense of intellect.](juggernaut.jpg)

This week’s mission has your Traders break into a Galactic Corps facility. It sounds dangerous, but the rewards are well worth the risk. If you can salvage some parts from their top-of-the-range Particle Transmitter you can upgrade your ship’s teleporter for a sure-fire means of extraction in future games. You might find yourself some valuable contraband in their evidence room too!
