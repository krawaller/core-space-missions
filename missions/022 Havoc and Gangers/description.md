This week’s free download ties in mechanically with Core Space: First Born, currently on Kickstarter!

There are no First Born – this mission is played using the existing range – but it is a solo mission with a stealth element added to the early stages, similar to how the First Born drones are used in the First Born rules.

A pirate gang have sent you on a rescue mission – their captain has been apprehended by the Galactic Corps and you’ll need to break them out! There is a very rare and powerful weapon up for grabs if you can manage it.

This mission requires the Shootout and Zed’s and Galactic Corps expansions to play.
