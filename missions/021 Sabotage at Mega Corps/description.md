This week’s free download is another from new recruit Andrew. A rival corporation has tipped you off that MegaCorp is working on some dangerous new technology, and your job is to infiltrate their research facility and destroy it. If nothing else it sounds like a perfect opportunity for some looting!

You’ll definitely need to take a technician though, getting through those firewalls won’t be easy!

This mission requires the Shift Change at MegaCorp and Galactic Corps expansions to play.
