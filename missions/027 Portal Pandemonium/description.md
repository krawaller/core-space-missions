In this week’s free mission, you’ve hard rumour of a large stash of Raw Blue in a MegaCorp facility, but the only way in is via a secure teleporter. It’ll be risky – can you get in and out before the Purge overrun the base?

This mission requires the Purge Outbreak and Shift Change at MegaCorp expansions and the Medical Research Lab terrain pack to play.
