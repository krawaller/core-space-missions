Core Space is popping up in retail stores around the world, and more and more people are finding out about the game. So, we wanted another mission that could be played with just the starter set to welcome all of our new Traders!

Like last time, this mission uses one of the existing maps from the Deluxe Rulebook. These pre-generated maps are very versatile and are a great way to get a game set up quickly.

In this mission, the Traders have turned bounty hunters, commissioned by the GCC to track down a rogue trader selling defective weaponry on the black market. Civilian injuries are being reported, but more importantly these defects are bad PR for the arms manufacturers…
