This month saw the release of Shootout at Zed’s, a Core Space expansion featuring the criminal gangers, a new type of NPC.

By now your Traders will be pretty experienced at fighting the Purge, so we thought what better way to show off the gangs than to give them centre-stage? That’s right, this week’s mission does not use the Purge at all!

![Whatever Chunk started life as he is now just a huge, drug fuelled meat-puppet, who does what Zed tells him and questions nothing but his next fix. This unhappy creature is the fusion of both technology and medication at the far end of ‘experimental’. A pet project of Zed’s, Chunk is never far from his side and will fly into a berserker rage at the merest nod from his master.](chunk.jpg)

You may think gangers are squishier than the Purge so it doesn’t sound like much of a challenge, but there’s a catch. You’re in their territory, and you’re heavily outnumbered from the start. You’ll need to stay cool and try to avoid detection as you search the area for some important documents.
