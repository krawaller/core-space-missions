This week’s free download is something a little different – it’s a ‘Salvage Run’ for the Dangerous Days age. It’s a generic mission to be played between campaign games to level up your crew or just for a break from the story. Salvage Run is great, but when you’re running a veteran crew under the Dangerous Days rules and your ship is falling apart sometimes a Salvage Run isn’t enough!

This mission sees your crew break into a Raw Blue processing facility to liberate some high-end ship parts and other equipment. Of course the Raw Blue will attract the Purge, and they’ve brought an Annihilator!

The story may be generic, but this allows the narrative nature of the core rules to shine, especially with so many threats to contend with. Good luck!

To play this mission you will need the Dangerous Days book, Purge Outbreak Expansion, Purge Reinforcements Booster, and the Shift Change at MegaCorp Expansion, which is now back in stock!
