Like Underworld Infiltration last year, this mission focuses on the Gangers as the main threat. For the first half of the game the Purge will not arrive, and the streets will instead be flooded with hardened criminals. You’ve found yourselves in a bar in the middle of a terrorist attack, and you need to fight your way back to the ship. The Gangers have other ideas though, and will be locking doors in your face and even disengaging your ship’s airlock!

This mission and more will soon be collated and published in a brand-new expansion book along with a new narrative campaign and lots of other exciting content.
