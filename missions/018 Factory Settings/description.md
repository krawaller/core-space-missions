In this week’s free download, your crew will infiltrate a processing plant for one of the biggest conglomerates in the galaxy. You’re not there for factory work though – you have reason to believe they are smuggling contraband in their goods and you want in! This could be a big score. Unless you get spotted of course – if that happens you’ll have to fight your way through an army of criminals to escape, but then again that sounds like a normal Monday…
