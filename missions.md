### 001 Lost in Space

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-01-lost-in-space

This week’s free download is a new solo side-mission for your campaigns. If you’re short on supplies between games you can head out into the unknown and see what you can salvage.

On this occasion you’ve come across a derelict ship floating through space and you venture on-board, but find yourself trapped and surrounded by the Purge! With the air running out this mission will be tough going, but if you can secure the wreckage it will be a great source of parts for a long time to come.

### 002 Egg Hunt

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-02-egg-hunt/

This week’s free download is a new side-mission for your campaigns for up to four players. It’s the perfect opportunity to add a couple of new crews (like the newly released Cygnus and Yamato packs) to the mix.

It’s a seasonal affair this time. Giger’s Emporium are hosting their annual Easter Egg Hunt and there are big prizes up for grabs. Send a couple of your Traders into the store to grab whatever they can, but be warned that they won’t be the only ones on the hunt…

### 003 The Titan Accord

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-03-the-titan-accord/

This week’s download is here by popular demand. The Titan Accord was a mission created during our Kickstarter to incorporate all of the various stretch goals and add-ons included within the pledge. It now serves as a prequel mission to the soon-to-be-released Purge: Outbreak expansion, detailing the start of the outbreak.

The mission makes use of the terrain and miniatures from the Shootout at Zed’s and Purge: Outbreak expansions, as well as the Galactic Corps miniatures included within the pledge. All of these products will be released at retail later in 2019, but non-backers can still play this mission in the meantime! As with all Core Space games there is room for customisation, so as long as you’ve got a second set of Battle Systems terrain to make a larger gaming area you can tweak the map to suit your collection and swap out any miniatures you don’t yet have for similar ones that you do.

### 004 Lost Action Hero

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-04-the-lost-action-hero

Last week saw the official release of the Poseidon Crew, led by Captain Oberon Teelac.

In this mission he finds himself drifting through space looking for a job that will bring him the approval he craves. And then one falls into his lap!

Theta Station is under attack by the Purge and he’s the only one close enough to save its inhabitants. The more people he can save with his thrilling heroics, the more people can go on to tell his story as the Hero of Theta!

### 005 Privacy Concerns

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-05-privacy-concerns/

This time we’re going to highlight one of the key features of the Deluxe Rulebook – the guidelines for designing your own missions!

As well as taking you step-by-step through designing your own scenarios for the game, the book also includes some pre-generated maps that can be used as a starting point. For this mission we’ve taken example map no. 5 from page 65 and assigned a narrative to it.

The large room in the bottom half of the map is crying out to be a focal point of the mission so we decided that getting there would be part of the objective. There are also some Civilians in that big office at the start of the game that could be related to our traders’ goal. The map doesn’t feel like a ship to me, but does make sense as an office complex. With these ideas as a starting point we need to fit a narrative around them, and where better to find a story than the real world! We took a topical theme and ran with it.

So, in this mission the Traders must infiltrate an office building belonging to one of the biggest tech corporations in the sector. There are rumours that the CEO has been dabbling in new AI technology, but not all is above board… The GCC believe that the massive amount of data required to run this new system is being harvested from unwitting civilians; reviewing their personal calls, private messages and social media without their consent. The GCC do not have the political clout to investigate without proof, but Trader crews have no such concerns!

With the story in place, the rest was easy. The rules for the CEO were added using standard rules from the book – Interacting with terrain and Moving Objects – and the tech prototypes and lack of weaponry were added for a bit of flavour. Seeing as weapons make up the majority of the token pool, removing them from the equation will make this mission far more interesting – there’s a chance to pick up some kit that would be otherwise hard to find, but you need to be tooled up with weapons in advance if you want to survive!

The final step was balance and fairness, hence the Secure Facility rule. This was added to give the Traders a chance to get to the CEO before the Purge did – it wouldn’t be much fun otherwise!

This mission uses two sets of terrain, so you will need an additional Cyberpunk Core Set. You’ll also need an additional crew (any will do) to use as Civilians. Don’t forget that with 4-6 crews in play you should add two pegs to the Hostility Tracker each round, and we recommend that you use the Purge Reinforcements pack too.

### 006 Dead Planet

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-06-dead-planet/

Just like last time, this mission takes one of the pre-made maps from the Deluxe Rulebook and adds a narrative to it. This mission also features the latest releases:

- Purge: Outbreak Expansion
- Purge Reinforcements Pack

I liked the idea of having spawn points in the middle of the map, which inspired a story about a planet already overrun with the Purge, and from there I decided that the story’s focus would be the Purge Mother.

In this mission, the Traders arrive after the Purge have wiped out a planet in order to salvage what’s left. They know that Purge Gatherers will be in the area assimilating everything that’s left, but that’s what they are here for – the Mother’s core can be used to create a powerful weapon. If the Traders can defeat her that is…

The pre-generated map was tweaked slightly to suit the mission – one of the airlock points was moved to make sure the Traders started out of the Mother’s line of sight, and the Reactor and Auto-doc from the Purge Outbreak expansion were added.

This mission will also make use of the Annihilator as well as the Purge Reinforcements, meaning double the number of Purge can be spawned. Be careful out there!

### 007 Rogue Trader

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-07-rogue-trader/

Core Space is popping up in retail stores around the world, and more and more people are finding out about the game. So, we wanted another mission that could be played with just the starter set to welcome all of our new Traders!

Like last time, this mission uses one of the existing maps from the Deluxe Rulebook. These pre-generated maps are very versatile and are a great way to get a game set up quickly.

In this mission, the Traders have turned bounty hunters, commissioned by the GCC to track down a rogue trader selling defective weaponry on the black market. Civilian injuries are being reported, but more importantly these defects are bad PR for the arms manufacturers…

### 008 Rescue on Daedalus

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-08-rescue-on-daedalus/

This week’s mission is inspired by a short story written back in 2017 during the Core Space Kickstarter. The story is available for download at https://www.dropbox.com/s/u8appesnsfj8pxa/Short%20Story%20-%20Rescue%20on%20Daedalus.pdf?dl=0.

This mission is playable with just the Starter Set, but is designed with some of the advanced rules in mind. The mission is best played with a Game Master (GM) who can shape the narrative and reveal hidden information to the other players during the game. If you intend to play the mission in this way and you are not the one running the game, do not read the mission download – give it to your GM so they can keep things secret.

By using a GM, Core Space can be played as a light RPG. Instead of controlling a crew themselves, the GM will instead be in charge of all the game’s decisions in order to build a narrative for the other players. The GM reads out the mission briefings, oversees any trades or disputes between players and generally manages the game. Instead of using the game’s AI, the GM will also take control of all the game’s NPCs, including the Purge!

For more on using a GM, check out the Deluxe Rulebook. You won’t need it to play this mission, but we recommend it anyway!

In this mission, the Traders have been hired to board the Daedalus, a derelict space ship, and find a data-chip left on board. When they arrive they find that the chip’s owner, a diplomat named Butler, is still alive, and they take advantage of the chance to rescue him and reap the rewards!

### 009 Power Outage

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-09-power-outage/

We recently relaunched our sci-fi terrain range, and we added some brand new kits including the Engineering Sector:

This set is a perfect centrepiece for themed missions in an industrial area or the inner workings of a space station. Today’s new mission does just that.

To play this mission you will need the Core Space Starter Set and the Engineering Sector terrain pack.

The terrain is fully interactive – this mission involves the Traders taking control of the cargo-bot shown above to repair the damaged engine core of a space station by retrieving parts from industrial equipment scattered around the board. Of course it won’t be that simple – the Purge will be bearing down on you from the start!

If you have the Deluxe Rulebook you can take advantage of some of the advanced rules as well. The Engineering Sector is a two-storey kit, so your Traders can jump (or fall) off of the gantry, and use the upper level as a great vantage point for shooting.

### 010 Underworld Infiltration

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-10-underworld-infiltration/

This month saw the release of Shootout at Zed’s, a Core Space expansion featuring the criminal gangers, a new type of NPC.

By now your Traders will be pretty experienced at fighting the Purge, so we thought what better way to show off the gangs than to give them centre-stage? That’s right, this week’s mission does not use the Purge at all!

You may think gangers are squishier than the Purge so it doesn’t sound like much of a challenge, but there’s a catch. You’re in their territory, and you’re heavily outnumbered from the start. You’ll need to stay cool and try to avoid detection as you search the area for some important documents.

### 011 Particular Transmission

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-11-particular-transmission/

This month the Galactic Corps arrive on the scene. This new Core Space expansion adds the Galactic Corps and Security Wardens as new NPCs, along with the usual host of scenery, equipment, cards, rules and missions.

This week’s mission has your Traders break into a Galactic Corps facility. It sounds dangerous, but the rewards are well worth the risk. If you can salvage some parts from their top-of-the-range Particle Transmitter you can upgrade your ship’s teleporter for a sure-fire means of extraction in future games. You might find yourself some valuable contraband in their evidence room too!

### 012 Role Reversal

https://battlesystems.co.uk/blog/mission-monday-12-role-reversal/

This latest mission is an example of where we took some models and terrain sets as inspiration, built a story around them, and added special rules to turn that narrative into a mission. Core Space is the perfect sandbox to turn any story into a playable game!

In this case, I wanted to use one of my favourite terrain sets, the Medical Research Lab, and also to get more use out of the new Galactic Corps expansion for Core Space. Of course the Purge are an integral part of most Core Space missions and therefore needed to be included, but as for who was operating on who, I turned that on its head.

I also took inspiration from some of the new rules being added in a new Core Space expansion coming in 2020, so they are hinted at here…

To complete this mission, you will need to infiltrate a Purge base and rescue a Galactic Corps director who has been inexplicably abducted by the Purge. To mix it up a bit, I added a mechanic where the Purge start the game on patrol and the Traders can avoid conflict by being stealthy early on. I translated this to the map by making sure there was a route that the Traders could take with minimal chance of Purge contact. This was balanced by the fact that the significant valuables available on this map aren’t on that route, and you will be very close to the Mother if she wakes up! The mission should be fairly easy early on, but all the Purge that arrive will surround the objective, so you need to be quick to rescue the prisoners before there are too many of them!

To play this mission you will need the Purge: Outbreak Expansion, a Medical Research Lab, and a Purge Reinforcements Booster. You won’t need the Galactic Corps Expansion to play this mission, but you will need it after the game, so this mission could be a good way to build up to adding them into your games.
